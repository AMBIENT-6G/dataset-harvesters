# Dataset Several (RF) Harvesters

This repository presents the evaluation and data collection of multiple energy harvesters, focusing on their performance under representative operating conditions. The measurements aim to provide a comparative overview of the capabilities and limitations of the different harvesting solutions. An overview of the evaluated harvesters and their key characteristics is provided in the table below.

| Harvester | Crucial component(s) | Tuning [MHz] | Link | Charger (PMU) | Voltage regulator (PMU) |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| NXP | sSUHFIPTIVA0 | 875 | [sSUHFIPTIVA0_875](https://github.com/AMBIENT-6G/dataset-harvesters/tree/main/sSUHFIPTIVA0_875) | No | No |
| NXP | sSUHFIPTIVA0 | 2500 | [sSUHFIPTIVA0_2500](https://github.com/AMBIENT-6G/dataset-harvesters/tree/main/sSUHFIPTIVA0_2500) | No | No |
